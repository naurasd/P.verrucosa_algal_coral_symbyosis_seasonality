# Environmental variability drives carbon and nitrogen allocation in the coral-algal symbiosis

In this repository you will find data and `R` scripts used in the manuscript by Tilstra and Daraghmeh et al. (2026).

Data files and scripts can be found in [Environmental parameters](Environmental%20parameters) and [Biological parameters](Biological%20parameters).

[Environmental parameters](Environmental%20parameters) contains `.xlsx` files with input data and associated `R` scripts for the analysis and (supplementary) figures / tables as used in the manuscript for the following environmental parameters:
- water temperature
- photosynthetically active radiation
- salinity
- dissolved oxygen
- dissolved nutrients (nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate)
- dissolved carbon

[Biological parameters](Biological%20parameters) contains `.xlsx` files with input data and associated `R` scripts for the analysis and (supplementary) figures / tables as used in the manuscript for the following biological parameters:
- Density, mitotic index and chlorophyll *a* content of algal symbiont cells in coral host tissue
- Elemental and stable isotope composition of nitrogen and organic carbon of coral host tissue and algal symbionts
- relative *nifH* gene copy numbers (diazotrophy)

[Biological parameters](Biological%20parameters) also contains data and code used for combined biological-environmental correlation analysis.
