# Input data, analysis and figures of environmental parameters
## Input data
The file `Environmental Data file Tilstra et al.xlsx` contains five sheets:
- The sheet `Temperature` contains all Sea Surface Temperature (SST) values in °C measured every 30 or 60 minutes from 1 January 2017 to 31 January 2018
  
- The sheet `all_monthly` contains all values of all parameters which were measured/calculated monthly on three consecutive days from January 2017 to January 2018:
  - Salinity in Practical Salinity Units (PSU)
  - Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) in umol photons m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>
  - Dissolved nitrate in uM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
  - Dissolved nitrite in uM NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>
  - Dissolved ammonium in uM NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>
  - Dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) in uM PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>
  - Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in uM N calculated as the sum of dissolved nitrate, nitrite and ammonium
  - The ratio of DIN:DIP as the calculated values of DIN divided by the respective DIP value
    
- The sheet `all_bimonthly` contains all values of all parameters which were measured/calculated bimonthly on two consecutive days from January 2017 to January 2018:
  - Dissolved oxygen (DO) in mg L<sup>-1</sup> (eight measurements each day) 
  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in uM C L<sup>-1</sup> (eight measurements each day)
  - Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in uM N L<sup>-1</sup> (eight measurements each day)
  - Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in uM N L<sup>-1</sup> calculated as TDN-DIN using the calculated DIN value of the same date
  - The ratio of DOC:DON as DOC divided by the respective calculated DON values
